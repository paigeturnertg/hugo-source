## About Me

I write illustrated transgender fiction exploring involuntary male-to-female transformation and its psychological consequences. My stories center on protagonists who build their own traps through logical decisions, exploited character flaws, or sophisticated manipulation—realizing too late they've passed the point of no return.

If you've read my work on Fictionmania or TG Storytime, you know what to expect: gradual transformations, status degradation, complex emotional landscapes, and characters who adapt without being grateful for their trauma. I've been reading TG fiction since the early 2000s, and these are the stories I always loved to read. Now I've decided to try my hand at writing them myself.

## Themes I Explore

My stories focus on transformation as consequence rather than wish fulfillment. I'm interested in how people rationalize their way into situations they can't escape, the psychology of adaptation under duress, and the gap between internal resistance and external compliance. 

The transformations in my work are gradual and irreversible, driven by realistic social and economic pressures or purpose-driven magic instead of sudden physical changes or unexplained supernatural forces. My protagonists aren't grateful for their circumstances—they're survivors navigating impossible situations where their agency erodes through a series of individually logical but cumulatively devastating choices. I explore power dynamics, manipulation, and the psychological toll of involuntary feminization, always grounding the fantasy in believable human behavior and emotional complexity.

## Community

I've set up a Discord server where readers can discuss my stories, share thoughts on transformation fiction, and connect with others who appreciate these narratives. [Join the conversation here.](https://discord.gg/w8ne2f7nX8)

## Support

I appreciate that some readers want to support my work financially, but I'd rather they that generosity elsewhere. If you'd like to contribute to a cause, please consider donating to the [Transgender Law Center](https://transgenderlawcenter.org/), an organization fighting for transgender rights and legal protections.
