## About Paige

I'm Paige Turner, and I write illustrated transgender fiction. I've been reading TG stories since the early 2000s—from alt.sex.stories to Nifty and Sapphire to Fictionmania and TGStorytime. These stories shaped my understanding of transformation narratives, and after years of reading, I recently decided to try creating the kind of fiction I always wanted to find more of.

I love slow builds where protagonists make reasonable decisions that accumulate into something irreversible, where they participate in their own transformation without realizing what's coming until it's too late. The loss of control, the moment of realization, the psychology of someone navigating an impossible situation—that's what keeps me writing.

I'm not above a good trope—they're tropes for a reason—but I try to find something new to say about them or explore an angle I haven't seen done before. My longer novels dig into power dynamics, manipulation, and the psychological toll of involuntary feminization. My shorter pieces are lighter genre explorations where the fun is in watching someone walk into a carefully constructed snare. 

I'm still learning as I go, challenging myself with each story, and developing as a writer. Not everything I write will be perfect, but I'm committed to getting better with every piece. I always appreciate reader feedback, good and bad, and would love to hear from you! Click on the envelope icon to the left to send me an email anytime.

## Themes I Explore

When I do go deeper, my stories focus on transformation as consequence rather than wish fulfillment. I'm interested in how people rationalize their way into situations they can't escape, the psychology of adaptation under duress, and the gap between internal resistance and external compliance.

The transformations in my work are gradual and irreversible, driven by realistic social and economic pressures or purpose-driven magic rather than sudden physical changes or unexplained supernatural forces. My protagonists aren't grateful for their circumstances—they're survivors navigating impossible situations where their agency erodes through a series of individually logical but cumulatively devastating choices.

## Community

I've set up a Discord server where readers can discuss my stories, share thoughts on transformation fiction, and connect with others who appreciate these narratives. [Join the conversation here.](https://discord.gg/w8ne2f7nX8)

## Support

I'm flattered when readers want to support my work financially, but I write for the love of it, not for income. If you're feeling generous, I'd be honored if you'd consider donating instead to the [Transgender Law Center](https://transgenderlawcenter.org/), an organization fighting for transgender rights and legal protections.
