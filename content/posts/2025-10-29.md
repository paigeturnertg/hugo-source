Guess we're going to find out if I really know what I'm doing.

<!--more-->

The site is a work in progress, but I've finally landed on a template I like so I'm relaunching and hoping to go from here! My goal is to eventually post here when I've added a new chapter to a story. And eventually, I'd like to host collected, polished "Author's Editions" of my works here in PDF form, for easy reading!

Stay tuned, lots more to come!
