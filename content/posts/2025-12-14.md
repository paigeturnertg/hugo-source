In the tradition of holiday specials of yore, I'm taking a quick break from my ongoing series to publish a couple Christmas-themed short stories. First up: Miss-ing You This Christmas, a Hallmark movie pastiche about a big-city journalist who comes to a small town and finds himself changed in the process. I hope you love it as much as I do!

Tits for Tates will return after the holidays.
