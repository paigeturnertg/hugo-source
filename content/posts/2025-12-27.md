One of the reasons I wanted to create my own site is to host polished PDF versions of complete stories I've previously published serially at sites like Fictionmania. The content would be essentially the same, with some editing tweaks and typo fixes I noticed after initial publication. And they'd be available for download in full, so readers can have "author's editions" of my works to keep and share however they like.

I finally got around to compiling my first PDF, and it's of Highway to Elle. The first few chapters of Elle were literally the first fiction I'd ever written, and I've learned a lot since then, so this edition includes some revisions to bring those early chapters up to the standard of the rest of the story. You can find it under the Downloads tab in the nav bar, or linked on the Elle story page. Enjoy!
