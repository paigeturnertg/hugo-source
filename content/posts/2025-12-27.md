One of the main reasons for starting my own site is that I've had the dream of hosting polished PDF versions of complete stories I've previously published serially at sites like Fictionmania. The content would be essentially the same, maybe with some editing tweaks that I noticed were necessary after I published them the first time. But they'd be available for download in full, so people could have "author's editions" of my works to read and share however you like.

I finally got around to compiling my first PDF, and it's of Highway to Elle. You can find it under the Downloads tab in the nav bar, or linked on the Elle story page. Enjoy!
