I've published a sequel to Hex Lives of College Girls! It's time to catch up with our old pals Kylie and Colette and learn how they've survived the weeks since Halloween, trapped in bodies they have no idea what to do with, living lives they know nothing about! It's a tale of horror and dread, perfect for reading next to a roaring fire on a twinkly holiday night!

Available now on Fictionmania and TGStorytime.
