"Miss-ing You This Christmas" started with a suggestion from Alanawriter: what if someone made a Hallmark Christmas movie... but with a TG twist? I couldn't resist. Hallmark movies have their own delightful formula—small towns, widowers with precocious kids, big city cynics who discover what really matters, Christmas magic that fixes everything. They're comfort food, and I wanted to see what happened when you added body transformation and gender identity to that mix. It ended up being my sweetest story to date, and I think it's a perfect little story for the holiday season.
