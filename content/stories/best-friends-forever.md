My third story, "Best Friends Forever"was an experiment: what happens if Paige is forced to write a story in 2 parts or less? After my first two stories ballooned way past their intended lengths, I was determined to stick to the limit here, as an exercise in developing my writing. The results were... mixed. Definitely the story that has gotten the most mixed feedback from readers, it is a tale that is both light and dark, and doesn't really give the characters enough space to develop like they need to. But at the same time, I really love the transformation method, the images, and the mirrored structure of the first and last scenes.
