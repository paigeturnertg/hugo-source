After writing "Highway to Elle," I needed a break from longer stories and wanted something fun, light, and--most importantly,--short. "Effortless Beauty" succeeded on 2 out of 3 - I wasn't planning on it, but it ended up being a 4-part story of a mystical curse that slowly feminizes slovenly, lazy Sam every time he takes a shortcut.
