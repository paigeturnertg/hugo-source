I wanted to write a sequel to "Hex Lives of College Girls," exploring what it would be like for these two newly-minted coeds to navigate their new lives without any of the knowledge or skills a woman has. What if there was a way to gain the knowledge they desperately needed? And what would be the cost? It's a dark story of mental transformation that explores questions of identity and self.
